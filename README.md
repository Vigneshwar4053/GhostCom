# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è GhostCom ‚Äì Anonymous & Secure Group Communication

GhostCom is an **anonymous, encrypted, and private group chat system** designed for those who need to communicate without fear of being tracked, watched, or identified. No emails. No phone numbers. No usernames. Just a **secret code**, encrypted messages, and trustless communication.

## üö® Why We Built GhostCom

In many places, people are afraid to speak up ‚Äî about corruption, injustice, or even everyday issues ‚Äî because systems aren't built to protect their identity. Apps collect too much data, governments track online activity, and privacy is often an illusion.

We built GhostCom because **privacy shouldn't be a privilege ‚Äî it should be a right**.

GhostCom aims to:

* Let people **speak freely** without revealing their identity.
* Provide a **safe space for groups** (activists, whistleblowers, close teams) to communicate.
* Ensure messages are **end-to-end encrypted** and **invisible to outsiders**.
* Enforce **VPN usage** for extra protection.
* Keep **no logs, no accounts, no metadata**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

- **Anonymous login** using strong, random secret codes
- **End-to-end encrypted group messaging** using AES-GCM (Web Crypto API)
- **Per-room random salt** for strong key derivation (PBKDF2)
- **Key fingerprinting** for users to verify secure conversations
- **No personal data, no profiles, no tracking**
- **Web Crypto API support check** for strong browser security
- **Real-time WebSocket chat** with zero-knowledge backend (server can't decrypt)
- **VPN-awareness** for safer connections
- **Auto-logout after inactivity** for privacy
- **Extensible codebase**: ready for more features (forward secrecy, push notifications, etc.)

- **Security**: 
    - Random salt per room for strong PBKDF2 key derivation
    - AES-GCM encryption with versioning and message authentication
    - Key fingerprint display for user confirmation
    - Unique message IDs for replay protection
    - Zero-knowledge server: only relays encrypted blobs
- **User Experience**: 
    - VPN check reminder
    - Auto-logout for inactivity
    - No logins, no tracking, no metadata
